# M_L_CODES
Here we will discuss some Machine Learning Algorithm.
The code of algorithm is given in sequence in same repository,here its explanation
Before starting each code let's see the common steps require for every Algorithm.
Step 1 => Load the Libraries
Step 2 => Import Dataset
Step 3 => Visualize dataset
Step 4 => Split the data into training & testing set.
Step 5 =>
